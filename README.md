# SilentCurtain

An open-source project to develop an active noise-cancelling curtain using Barium Calcium Titanate (BCT) technology.

## Introduction

This project aims to create a high-performance, active noise-cancelling curtain by utilizing the piezoelectric properties of Barium Calcium Titanate (BCT). The curtain will be capable of significantly reducing ambient noise through active noise cancellation (ANC) technology.

## Features

- Active noise cancellation using BCT fibers
- Real-time sound wave detection and cancellation
- Flexible and durable curtain material
- Suitable for residential and commercial use

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of electronics and sound engineering
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub
- Access to BCT materials and necessary hardware
